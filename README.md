Hello, I'm a curious and enthusiastic student from S1, passionate about exploring and learning new things. I'm a dedicated and honest individual who takes pride in my work and strive to deliver my best efforts. Although I'm still discovering my areas of interest, I'm excited to join FOSS and exploring various opportunities. I believe this experience will help me discover my strengths and interests, and I'm eager to contribute and learn from the club. Thank you..
